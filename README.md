# 🌟 GenAI-plus Repository 🌟

Welcome to the **GenAI-plus** repository – a continuation and evolution of my previous project, [GenAI](https://runarok.github.io/GenAI/). In this repo, I'm still using AI, but this time with more advanced tools, refined ideas, and a better understanding of what I want to build. Think of this as the **next chapter** – a spiritual sequel with more experimentation, creativity, and learning.

## 🧬 What is GenAI-plus?

**GenAI-plus** is a blend of AI-generated and human-refined code. It’s built using a variety of tools and assistants such as:

* 🖱️ **Cursor**
* 🤖 **GitHub Copilot**
* ⚡ **Bolt**
* 🌊 **Windsurf**
* 💬 **ChatGPT**
* ❤️ And of course, my own contributions

These tools helped me ideate, debug, and explore faster, but every project here carries my personal touches, design decisions, and refinements.

## 📅 Timeline & Evolution

### 🏁 **Origins: GenAI**

* **5th Semester (2024)**

### 🚀 **Now: GenAI-plus**

* **Started: May 31, 2025**
* Aiming for more structure, versioning (`v0`, `v1`, etc.), and cleaner execution.
* Focused on **learning by doing**, even if it’s slow.

This project is not about being perfect or deeply technical from day one — it’s about expressing creativity, having fun with code, and building things I enjoy. I'm not rushing to become an expert. Instead, I'm letting AI help while I take my time to learn the fundamentals properly… someday.

---

## 🎯 Goals of GenAI-plus

* **Build with intention**, not just completion.
* **Use AI creatively**, not blindly.
* **Gradually reduce dependence** on AI as I improve my own coding skills.
* Eventually, **pause GitHub** and code a complete project from scratch, fully authored by me.

---

## 📌 Project Status

As of now:

* Projects will be released iteratively.
* Major updates or versions will follow a `v0`, `v1`, etc. naming scheme.
* I'm experimenting freely, without pressure.

Stay tuned for upcoming additions!

### 💬 Final Words

> I still use AI heavily – not because I don’t want to learn, but because I’m slow at it.
> I **do want to learn properly** someday, and I’m getting there… bit by bit.
> For now, I’m doing what I **enjoy**, and that’s what matters most.
